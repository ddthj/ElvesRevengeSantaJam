# ElvesRevengeSantaJam

This is a game I created for the 2021 Secret Santa Game Jam

You are playing as Santa in a rather unfortunate situation, the elves are on strike! They don't seem to want to negotiate either, and are going right for the buildings!

Use WASD to move
left-click to throw snowballs against the assaliants. Snowballs also put out fires, should the situation escalate to that!

right-click to pick up or drop snow

E to build a snowman

See how many waves of elves you can survive!
